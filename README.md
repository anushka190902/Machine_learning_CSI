# Summer Internship in Data Science at Celebal Technologies

## Overview

During my summer internship at **Celebal Technologies**, I worked in the **data science domain** focusing on implementing and optimizing machine learning algorithms for **regression** and **classification tasks**. This project aimed to develop predictive models and explore techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency, contributing to real-world problem-solving applications.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Explored Data**: Conducted data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis to ensure datasets were optimized for machine learning models.
- **Implemented Machine Learning Algorithms**: 
  - **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), etc.
  - **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Used metrics such as RMSE, MAE, RÂ² for regression, and accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for classification.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Leveraged techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model performance.
- **Automation**: Developed reusable code modules to streamline tasks for future projects.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
- **Version Control**: Git for managing project updates and versioning
- **Collaboration Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab for documentation and implementation

## Key Learnings and Contributions

1. **Hands-on Experience**: Gained practical exposure to machine learning workflows from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment.
2. **Problem Solving**: Addressed real-world challenges like imbalanced datasets, missing data, and overfitting.

## Project Highlights

- **Regression Use Case**: Predicted sales for a retail dataset with high accuracy by implementing ensemble learning techniques.
- **Classification Use Case**: Built a model to classify customer churn, leveraging advanced techniques like feature engineering and oversampling (SMOTE).

## Conclusion

This internship provided a solid foundation in **machine learning algorithms** and their applications in regression and classification. It enhanced my understanding of the end-to-end data science pipeline and equipped me with skills to tackle real-world problems effectively.
